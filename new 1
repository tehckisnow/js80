//call game engine constructor
let game = new js90.Game({settings});
game.start(); //<-- what does this do? (triggers call to frame() for one

//js80
//---------------------------------------------
engine.main:
  reset(): reset game to initial state
  preload(): cache assets files, show loading screen?
  start(); begin calling frame() if it exists
    developer can choose to call game.systems.manager.updateAll() inside of
      gameloop or can manually call systems as needed

systems manager:
  active systems: []
  updateAllSystems()
  updateActiveSystems()

log manager
  js80.log();
  engine.log();

initialize engine
  call settings manager
  create necessary objects

settings manager
  //creates a new settings object to be stored in (game object?)
  //methods for updating settings
  create canvas if necessary
  render frame if neccessary
  set window title
  set canvas size
  theme defaults?
  default update() order executed by systems manager

DOM manager
  //create and manage DOM elements
  //should this be consolidated into asset manager?
  dom.newCanvas(x, y, z);
  dom.buildBezel(dom.defaultBezel);
  //! should reactive methods be here? Or in render system? or elsewhere?
  //include script calls so that game scripts don't need to be manually added 
  //    to html file; merely list them in the game file, and mention the game
  //    file and engine in the html file

asset manager
  //assets are objects that contain data, such as the filepath to a file asset
  default asset directory string (pulled from settings)
  default specific asset directory(sound, map, sprite, etc)
  //methods to process asset data (such as prepending the filepath, or converting 1d arrays to 2d)
  
  assets: [] //holds references to all asset data so that systems can 
    //act on them easier, such as "stopAllAudio()" or "destroyAllSprites()"
  
  sprites
    asset file
    tile-size
    height
    width
  maps
    mapLayers
      tilesheet/image
      layer#
      tile-size
      width
      height
      type? (tile, collidable tile, entity position tile)
  audio
    file
    data
    controller (methods to manipulate) //or should this be in a "audio manager"?
  drawMaps(?)
  animation
    tilesheet/spritesheet
    tilesize
    width
    height
    anims:
      {name: "name", frames: [4,5,6,7]}
    //framerate: (aside from global one that is set in settings,
    //  should each entity have one? Or each animation component?
    //  or each animation?

UI system:
  buttons
  textboxes
    themes
    textboxes
    textbox controller  //! (global or per textbox?)
    lineConstructor()
  menus
    menu controller  //! (global or per textbox?)
    choiceConstructor()
    
  "healthbars" (what should this be called?  status indicators?)
  indicators (arrows, selection boxes)
  
  update()
  //checks indicators, healthbars, textboxes, and menus and updates them accordingly
  
  //! how to reconcile with render system?  Does this system communicate with render?

input manager
  "input" constructor: creates reference to and adds new key to watch
  input modes? (or manually use game states?

collision system:
  tile based
  volume based (axis locked)
  hybrid

event manager:
  interactions
  timers
  step-triggers
  other conditionals?
  
  sort(){}  //groups events based on type so that update only checks appropriate events
  update(){} //checks the appropriate events for truth
  
  //idea: instead of different types of events, 
  //an event is an object that contains:
  {
    id: 0,
    triggerType: "collision",
    trigger: function(x){if(x = trigger.x){return true)},
    effect: function(){},
    conditions: functions(){},
    whenToCheck: //???? (each frame, onStep, onCollision, onKeypress)
  }//refine this!
  
  organize events by type so that only appropriate ones are checked each frame
  idea:
    let newEvent = new event(trigger, effect, additionalConditionals, persistent)
    types of triggers:
      collision
      timer
      interaction
      conditional(?)
      other
      
scene manager
  scene constructor: add scene into scene manager and autostart if true
  scene.toTop() => brings a scene to the top of the stack so it will render on top
  scene.moveDown() and scene.moveUp (called by manager or by scene?)
  a scene can be paused or resumed
  a scene can be "launched" or saved to be launched later.
  run or update or sleep or wake 
  start or stop
  
camera manager
  talks to render system to apply x/y/z offset
  converts between global and screen coordinates?
  also establishes viewing area (independant from canvas size)
  transition effects like fade and dissolve?
  commonModes:
    manual: (call camera.move({x:100, y:200, time: 400})
    follow: (follow a particular entity)
    followDelay: (follows an entity as they approach the edge of the screen)

game state manager
  let manager = new StateManager(){}
  {variable: "gameState", values: ["default", "paused", "menu"]
  remember x previous game states
  
input controller constructor
  //tell dom system to set up keyboard init
  // track which keys the input system will listen for
  input constructor()
    input.btn()
    input.btnp()
    destroy() (remove a key from this list if it is no longer needed)
      (judicial use of this could improve performance)
    click() (trigger an event on mouseclick (left, right, middle)
    mouse() (returns mouse coordinates)
    
collision system
    //methods to check for collisions (tile-based, 

render system
    //control z depth of map layers and entities
    //make everything scalable (including textbox themes)
    cls()
    spr()
    line()
    rect()
    rectb()
    circ()
    circb()
    text()
    map() //draw map to screen based on 2d array and tileset (manual or using asset system map?)
    mset() //change a maptile in a map
    
    mget() //!this is not a render method: where should it be moved? asset system?
    
entity system
    //entity constructor
    //templates (create customizable default entities for common things like npcs)

animation system
    //update a sprite's current active frame based on data
    //!does this talk to asset system? or should it be a subsystem of asset?

save system
  constructor
  keep track of what variables should be saved
  methods for saving, loading, and updating these variables

movement system
  a group of constructors for modifiable default movement systems for entities to use
    tile-based
    free-movement
  applyMovement() reference values and adjusts xyz positions accordingly
    talk to physics system?
  
npcGenerator()
  x/y/z
  sprite/animations
  events/triggers
    dialogue
    interactions
    actions
      movement
      turn
      find entity
    behavior
      chooses an action


main update loop:
  calls frame() 60 times per sec
  frame() can call various systems' update() function
  
engine.systems.updateAll();
engine.systems.updateAllActive();


 --------------------------

 let engine = new js80({})
 engine.render()
 
 
----------------------------------
various systems such as those that used to be in the ecs subsystem
  follow the form:
 
systemName: {
  entitiesTracked: [],
  nextId: 0,
  new: function(){},
  update: function(){},
}

where should the tracking array be stored? 
  have a unique list in each "scene"?  
  have a global list for the entire game?
  have both?
  

--------------------------------
when a new game is created, a settings object and a data object are generated
  data object holds asset data like audio and sprites
  //! should these be combined in to one thing?

----------------------------------
//should there be an audio-controller system?
//  Or should a method in the asset system handle it?
